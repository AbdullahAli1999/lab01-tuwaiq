           //2. Write a Java program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.
           
           i used loop to ask user to multiply any number up to 10 

          // 6. Write a Java program to reverse a word.
          i used loop to read a length of word  and revers it and i used charAt to take the letter for index it means give the charAt the position of letter and the charAt take it 

 
          // 9.Write a Java program that takes a string and a number from the user,then prints the character in the given index.
          i asked user to enter phrase and number and i used char with the number to print the letter 


          //16 - Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed.
          i used while loop if tne number not equal 0 and i did some math for revers digits

          //17 - Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end the program should display the largest and smallest numbers entered.
          i used while loop and i put range for large and small and i used if to compare between number and if user enter -1 it mean stop and print the largest and samllest.

          //18 - Determine and print the number of times the character ‘a’ appears in the input entered by the user.
          i uesd for loop to read the length of string and charAt if equal 'a'
